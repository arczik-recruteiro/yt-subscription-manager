# Youtube Subscription Manager

## Description

There are two sole purposes f that project:

- Learning
- Getting rid of yt subscription made by my kids

`npm install --force `

**--force** parameters are required because of **react-google-login** library. It uses react 17, but I decided to go with 18.

## Running

npm start
